Crime rate prediction is a crucial application of machine learning in law enforcement and urban planning. This project leverages different ML techniques to analyze crime data and build predictive models that can provide insights into crime trends based on historical data.

Machine Learning Models Implemented:
1.Linear Regression – Predicting crime rates as a continuous variable
2.Logistic Regression – Binary classification of crime occurrence
3.Support Vector Machines (SVM) – Classification and trend detection
4.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – Pattern recognition in crime data
5.Naïve Bayes – Probabilistic crime classification
6.Decision Trees & Random Forests – Understanding crime patterns with tree-based models
7.Principal Component Analysis (PCA) – Dimensionality reduction to improve model efficiency

Technologies & Libraries Used:
1.Python (Programming Language)
2.NumPy – Numerical computations
3.Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis
4.Scikit-Learn – Machine learning models and evaluation
5.Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
6.Pickle – Model serialization for future use

Features
1.Data preprocessing and feature engineering
2.Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
3.Model training, evaluation, and comparison
4.Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy
5.Crime trend insights using statistical and ML techniques
